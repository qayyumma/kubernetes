Multiple Schedulers in Kubernetes

By default, Kubernetes uses a default scheduler (kube-scheduler) to place pods on nodes. But you can also run multiple custom schedulers in a cluster. This is useful when:

You want different scheduling logic for different pods.

You want to test custom scheduling algorithms without interfering with production workloads.

How to Use Multiple Schedulers

Step 1: Run an additional scheduler

Run another scheduler as a separate pod (can be in its own deployment):

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-custom-scheduler
spec:
  containers:
  - name: scheduler
    image: my-custom-scheduler:latest
    command:
      - /my-scheduler

```

This scheduler should:

Watch Pod objects where spec.schedulerName == "my-scheduler"

Schedule only those pods.

Step 2: Create a pod that uses your custom scheduler

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  schedulerName: my-scheduler
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx

```

Now this pod will be scheduled only by the scheduler with name my-scheduler.

Kubernetes Default Scheduler Behavior

If no schedulerName is specified, the default scheduler (kube-scheduler) handles it.

If you set a custom name (e.g., my-scheduler) but no scheduler with that name is running, the pod will remain in Pending state.
