NoSchedule:	Do not schedule pods here unless they tolerate the taint

PreferNoSchedule:	Avoid scheduling, but not guaranteed

NoExecute:	Evict existing pods unless they tolerate the taint

1. Taint (Applied to Node)

```
kubectl taint nodes worker-node-1 env=prod:NoSchedule
```

2. Toleration (Added to Pod Spec)

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: tolerant-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  tolerations:
  - key: "env"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "prod"
    effect: "NoSchedule"

```

3. Remove a Taint

```
kubectl taint nodes worker-node-1 env=prod:NoSchedule-
```
