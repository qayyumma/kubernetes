Multiple Schedulers in Kubernetes

By default, Kubernetes uses a default scheduler (kube-scheduler) to place pods on nodes. But you can also run multiple custom schedulers in a cluster. This is useful when:

You want different scheduling logic for different pods.

You want to test custom scheduling algorithms without interfering with production workloads.

How to Use Multiple Schedulers

Step 1: Run an additional scheduler

Run another scheduler as a separate pod (can be in its own deployment):

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-custom-scheduler
spec:
  containers:
  - name: scheduler
    image: my-custom-scheduler:latest
    command:
      - /my-scheduler

```

This scheduler should:

Watch Pod objects where spec.schedulerName == "my-scheduler"

Schedule only those pods.

Step 2: Create a pod that uses your custom scheduler

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  schedulerName: my-scheduler
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx

```

Now this pod will be scheduled only by the scheduler with name my-scheduler.

Kubernetes Default Scheduler Behavior

If no schedulerName is specified, the default scheduler (kube-scheduler) handles it.

If you set a custom name (e.g., my-scheduler) but no scheduler with that name is running, the pod will remain in Pending state.


Configuring Scheduler Profiles in Kubernetes

Starting from Kubernetes v1.19+, the kube-scheduler supports multiple scheduling profiles via its Policy API. This allows you to define different scheduling behaviors (plugins, priorities, filters, etc.) for different sets of pods using the schedulerName.

Why Use Scheduler Profiles?
Apply different scheduling logic (e.g., use NodeAffinity, PodTopologySpread, ResourceLimits) for different workloads.

Still use only one kube-scheduler process â€” just switch behavior based on schedulerName.

Example: Configure kube-scheduler with 2 profiles

Step 1: Create a scheduler configuration file

# scheduler-config.yaml
```
apiVersion: kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: KubeSchedulerConfiguration
profiles:
  - schedulerName: default-scheduler
    plugins:
      score:
        enabled:
          - name: NodeResourcesBalancedAllocation
  - schedulerName: high-priority-scheduler
    plugins:
      score:
        enabled:
          - name: NodeAffinity
This example does:

default-scheduler: uses NodeResourcesBalancedAllocation

high-priority-scheduler: uses NodeAffinity
```

Step 2: Run kube-scheduler with custom config

If self-hosted:

kube-scheduler --config=/etc/kubernetes/scheduler-config.yaml

In a static pod:

command:
```
  - kube-scheduler
  - --config=/etc/kubernetes/scheduler-config.yaml
```

Step 3: Use the custom profile in a Pod
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  schedulerName: high-priority-scheduler
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

ðŸ“Œ Notes

All profiles run in the same scheduler process.

You can define different plugins (filters, scores, binders) for each.

If a pod does not specify schedulerName, it uses the first profile (typically default-scheduler).

NodeAffinity Plugin in the Scheduler

ðŸ”¹ What is it?
The NodeAffinity plugin tells the scheduler to score nodes higher that match the pod's nodeAffinity rules.

This is part of the scoring phase of scheduling, which ranks the best possible nodes after filtering.

Understanding Scheduling Phases

Filtering: Remove nodes that donâ€™t satisfy hard rules (like not enough CPU).

Scoring: Assign scores (0â€“100) to remaining nodes based on things like:

Resource balance

Pod affinity/anti-affinity

Node affinity (this one)
