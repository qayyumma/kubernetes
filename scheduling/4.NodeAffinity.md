Itâ€™s a node selection constraint.

A more flexible and expressive alternative to nodeSelector.

Can specify required or preferred node placement rules.

```
kubectl label nodes worker-node-1 disktype=ssd
```

1.Create a Pod with requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution (hard rule)

The pod must be scheduled on a node with label disktype=ssd.

If no such node exists, the pod will remain unscheduled.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-affinity
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: disktype
            operator: In
            values:
            - ssd
```

2. Use preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution (soft rule)

```
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
    - weight: 1
      preference:
        matchExpressions:
        - key: disktype
          operator: In
          values:
          - ssd

```

Full Pod YAML (with both required and preferred):

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-node-affinity
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: disktype
            operator: In
            values:
            - ssd
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 1
        preference:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: zone
            operator: In
            values:
            - zone-a

```
