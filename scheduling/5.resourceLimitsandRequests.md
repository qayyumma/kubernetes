Kubernetes Resource Limits and Requests (with Example)

Kubernetes lets you define how much CPU and memory (RAM) a container:

requests (minimum needed to run)

limits (maximum it can use)

Why Use It?

Prevent a pod from consuming all resources.

Ensure fair sharing between pods.

Helps the scheduler place pods on suitable nodes.

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: resource-demo-deploy
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: resource-demo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: resource-demo
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
```

Kubernetes reserves 64Mi memory and 250 millicores of CPU on a node for this container.

The container canâ€™t use more than 128Mi memory or 500m CPU.

If it exceeds the memory limit, it gets killed.

If it tries to use more CPU than allowed, it gets throttled.
