PriorityClass is used in Kubernetes to control which pods get scheduled or evicted first when resources are limited.

When the cluster is under pressure:

Pods with lower priority are evicted first.

Pods with higher priority are scheduled before others.

Helps define critical workloads (e.g., monitoring, API servers).

You create a PriorityClass object.

Then, reference it in your Pod spec with priorityClassName.

Example: Create a PriorityClass

```
apiVersion: scheduling.k8s.io/v1
kind: PriorityClass
metadata:
  name: high-priority
value: 100000
globalDefault: false
description: "This priority class is for important workloads"

```

value: Integer (higher = more priority).

globalDefault: Only one can be true (used if no priorityClass is set on a pod).

description: Helpful note.

This PriorityClass will automatically be assigned to all pods that do NOT explicitly specify a priorityClassName.

Only One Allowed

You can have only one PriorityClass with globalDefault: true in a cluster. If you try to create another one with globalDefault: true, it will throw an error.

Example Pod Using the Priority Class

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: important-pod
spec:
  priorityClassName: high-priority
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx

```
